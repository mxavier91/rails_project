First Day Working on Back End

My first day I started working on the back end was also the first day of project work time. I started the day by just focusing on planning. I spoke with some classmates and
instructors about my ERDs and how I should tackle this project. I was a little uneasy by Ruby and Ruby on Rails, so I looked back at alot of my notes, and lessons that I had on Ruby and Ruby on Rails. After a couple hours of planning, I decided it was time to get to work.

Day 2

On the second day, I actually started to write code. I decided that the first thing I was going to focus on making a one to many relationship. This relationship would be Users has_many Movies, and Movies belong_to Users. I created my table by using scaffold. The table was called Movies, with colunms for ID, Title, Director, and Actor. I wanted the user to have to sign in before being able to interact with the site, so I had my MovieController inherit a ProtectdController. I also played around with some of the code to make it so the User signed in has ownership of anything created, deleted or updated.

Day 3

Day 3 I focused on testing my scripts. I went into the terminal and tested all of my Authorization scripts, and my CRUD scripts. Once those successfully went through, I went straight to the back end.
