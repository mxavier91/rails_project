<h1>Back-End Development</h1>

This is my first time working on a Full-Stack Web App, and my second web app project while attend General Assembly.

Most important this is the first time that I'm creating an app from my own idea. There were a few ideas that I add for my Full-Stack web app, but the one that stuck with me the most was a movie app. I was hoping that this app would allow user to at least store movies that they have already watched.

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
After completing the project, I satisfied with it, but not completely. In the future I want to do more work with Ruby on Rails, in order to make a more detailed API, that allows the user to do more.
